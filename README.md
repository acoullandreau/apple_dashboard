# Apple Music data analysis


Welcome! In this repository, you will find the Jupyter notebook I built when exploring my personal Apple Music data. 

Context of this project
------------------------

I started using Apple Music in 2016, and when I found out I could request an archive with all my usage data, I was thrilled! 

I decided to dive into this data and perform some data analysis and build visualizations. I walk through the process of discovery, exploration of the data, cleaning and wrangling, and visualizing the data in the Jupyter notebook of this repository.

Follow-up
----------

When I was happy with what I got, I actually started thinking about the next steps! 
It occured to me, after a few hours wrangling, cleaning, looking from different angles at the data, that it may be useful for other people to be able to dive into their own data without going through the trouble of parsing and processing it all. And just like that, two projects were born: a python package, and a webpage for anyone to parse/process locally and visualize a set of nice graphs and representation. 

Please check out the Python package I made!
